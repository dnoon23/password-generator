# <Password Generator>

## Description


<p>
In this project I created a webpage to generate a password based on user prompts.  The user can decide how long they want their password to be and what kind of characters they want included in their password (i.e. upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and symbols).  During this challenge I learned how to use alerts and prompts to engage with the user and how to store these inputs to use in the code to reach a desired outcome.  The most difficult part of the project was getting the functions to loop themselves properly if there was and undesirable input selected.  Another part that was difficult for me was being able to store the password and display it properly on the webpage.

## Usage

To use the website open it in any browser and press the 'Generate Password' button.  The browser will begin to open prompts asking to specify how they would like their password.  Starting with an input field asking how long the password should be.  Next the user will receive prompts about what kind of characters should be included in the password.  If they would like the specific type of character the user should press 'OK', if not they should press "Cancel'.  The website also opens up prompts to let the user know whether or not each type of character was added.  After going through all the prompts the password will be displayed in on the webpage.
